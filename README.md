# Custom Data.ipynb

This notebook is the most basic NN made with PyTorch.

It loads data found in "/home/ebouletg/3IMA/DL_master/Jupyther_notebook/PPC2/Train" as Training sample.

And the one in "/home/ebouletg/3IMA/DL_master/Jupyther_notebook/PPC2/Test" as Test sample.

The current size of the picture was set to 32*32 because of the hardware that was available to me.

The NN is expected to reach 43% accuracy when working on a simple Paper/Rock/Scissor case, thus increasing the accuracy from 10% from a system of would take blind guess.
